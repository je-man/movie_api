      <h2>Using the API</h2>
      <p>
        We built the API to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find
        yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into four major areas.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Getting started introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
        </li>
        <li>
          API calls gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an
          interactive console.
        </li>
        <li>
          Field reference lists and describes the type of information provided
          by the API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contact Us If you need support or need to get in touch, this is the
          place to look.
